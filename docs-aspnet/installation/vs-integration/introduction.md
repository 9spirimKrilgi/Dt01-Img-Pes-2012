# Visual Studio Integration Overview

The Progress&reg; Telerik&reg; UI for ASP.NET Core Visual Studio (VS) Extensions enhance the experience in developing MVC web applications with Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core. This document describes how to locate the Telerik extensions in VS 2017 and 2019.

The Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core VS extensions support VS 2017 and 2019 and are distributed with the Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core installer. Before you can use them, you must download and run the [installer]({% slug msi_install_aspnetmvc6_aspnetmvc %}#download).

The VS extensions offer the following benefits:

* They include Project Templates.

* They handle the [creation of projects]({% slug gettingstarted_aspnetmvc6_aspnetmvc %}#configuration-Create) and the related configuration, references, and web.config modifications.

* They help you to keep your project up to date with the new Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core versions.

## Visual Studio 2019

To access the VS extensions in VS 2019, use the **Extensions | Telerik | Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core** menu on the VS 2019 **Menu bar**. Select **Create New Telerik Project** to add the project template.
