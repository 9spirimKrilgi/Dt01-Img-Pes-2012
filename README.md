  What is dt01.img file in PES 2012 and how to fix it?  
PES 2012, or Pro Evolution Soccer 2012, is a popular football simulation video game developed and published by Konami. The game features various modes, teams, players, stadiums, and graphics that aim to provide a realistic and enjoyable football experience. However, some players may encounter a problem with the dt01.img file, which is one of the game's data files that contains information about the national anthems and chants of the teams. This problem may cause the game to crash or freeze, or prevent the sound from playing properly.
  
The dt01.img file is located in the img folder of the game's installation directory. For example, if you installed the game in C:\Program Files\Konami\PES 2012, then the dt01.img file should be in C:\Program Files\Konami\PES 2012\img. The file size should be around 1.3 GB, and the file type should be IMG File. If you have a different file size or type, or if the file is missing or corrupted, then you may have a problem with the dt01.img file.
