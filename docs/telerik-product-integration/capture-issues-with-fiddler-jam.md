## Capture Kendo UI jQuery network logs & log issues with Fiddler Jam

[Fiddler Jam](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler-jam) is Telerik tool designed to record network activity, capture console logs and screenshots. A simple capture log from the end-user can provide the following information:

- Video recording and screenshots
- Console logs and errors
- Network capture
- Local and Session Storage logs
- User action events
